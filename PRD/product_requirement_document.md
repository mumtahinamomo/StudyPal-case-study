## 1. Purpose

StudyPal is an AI-powered academic assistant designed to help college students centralize their study materials, transform raw course content into structured, digestible notes, and provide adaptive learning tools that improve comprehension and retention.

Today, students manage scattered resources across cloud drives, email attachments, screenshots, and recordings, making it hard to review efficiently and consistently. StudyPal solves this by acting as a “study command center” by storing, organizing, and analyzing all materials, and then delivering personalized study aids like summaries, flashcards, and quizzes.

**Goal:** Reduce the time and cognitive effort spent on manual study prep so students can focus on understanding and applying their knowledge.

## 2. Background & Business Case

### Market Context
- Global edtech market expected to reach $404B by 2025, driven by AI adoption.
- Hybrid and asynchronous learning models are becoming the norm post-pandemic.
- Students increasingly rely on AI tools but lack integrated platforms tailored to their specific coursework.

### Problem
- Students waste significant time collecting, cleaning, and organizing study materials.
- Generic AI chatbots provide answers without context or alignment to coursework.
- Many existing tools (Notion AI, ChatGPT, QANDA) focus on either note-taking or Q&A, but not both in a unified, adaptive platform.

### Opportunity — How StudyPal Differentiates
- Handles multi-modal input (text, audio, video, images).
- Grounds all AI output in the student’s own materials for context accuracy.
- Offers active & passive learning modes (quizzes, spaced repetition, micro-recaps).

### Business Value
- Direct-to-student subscription model (freemium → premium).
- Potential partnerships with universities for campus-wide adoption.
- Strong brand positioning in the AI-in-education market.

## 3. Goals & Non-Goals

### 3.1 Goals (MVP Scope)
1. **Centralized Material Management:** Upload, store, and organize academic content in multiple formats (PDF, PPT, DOCX, TXT, video, audio, image) with automatic tagging.
2. **Contextual AI Summaries:** Generate structured notes, visual mind maps, and transcripts grounded in the user’s uploaded materials.
3. **Personal AI Tutor:** Contextual Q&A with adjustable explanation depth (“ELI5” → graduate level).
4. **Passive Learning:** Daily “What to Know” cards and audio recaps to reinforce learning.
5. **Self-Testing Tools:** Flashcards and quizzes from user content with progress tracking and spaced repetition.
6. **Search & Retrieval:** Fast, accurate keyword and natural language search across all uploaded materials.
7. **Accessibility & Usability:** Simple, intuitive interface for non-technical users.

### 3.2 Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. **Full Mobile App:** MVP is web-based; mobile optimization and native apps are post-MVP.
2. **Collaborative Real-Time Editing:** Only single-user editing of AI-generated notes; multi-user real-time editing is out of scope.
